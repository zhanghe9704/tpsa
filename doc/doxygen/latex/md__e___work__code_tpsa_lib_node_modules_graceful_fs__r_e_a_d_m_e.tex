graceful-\/fs functions as a drop-\/in replacement for the fs module, making various improvements.

The improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different platforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more resilient to errors.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1267}{}\doxysection{Improvements over $<$a href=\char`\"{}https\+://nodejs.\+org/api/fs.\+html\char`\"{}$>$fs module$<$/a$>$}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1267}

On Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if {\ttfamily EACCESS} or {\ttfamily EPERM} error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked the directory.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1268}{}\doxysection{USAGE}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1268}

This module cannot intercept or handle {\ttfamily EMFILE} or {\ttfamily ENFILE} errors from sync methods. If you use sync methods which open file descriptors then you are responsible for dealing with any errors.

This is a known limitation, not a bug.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1270}{}\doxysection{Global Patching}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1270}
If you want to patch the global fs module (or any other fs-\/like module) you can do this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{// Make sure to read the caveat below.}
\DoxyCodeLine{var realFs = require('fs')}
\DoxyCodeLine{var gracefulFs = require('graceful-\/fs')}

This should only ever be done at the top-\/level application layer, in order to delay on EMFILE errors from any fs-\/using dependencies. You should {\bfseries{not}} do this in a library, because it can cause unexpected delays in other parts of the program.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1271}{}\doxysection{Changes}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1271}
This module is fairly stable at this point, and used by a lot of things. That being said, because it implements a subtle behavior change in a core part of the node API, even modest changes can be extremely breaking, and the versioning is thus biased towards bumping the major when in doubt.

The main change between major versions has been switching between providing a fully-\/patched {\ttfamily fs} module vs monkey-\/patching the node core builtin, and the approach by which a non-\/monkey-\/patched {\ttfamily fs} was created.

The goal is to trade {\ttfamily EMFILE} errors for slower fs operations. So, if you try to open a zillion files, rather than crashing, {\ttfamily open} operations will be queued up and wait for something else to {\ttfamily close}.

There are advantages to each approach. Monkey-\/patching the fs means that no {\ttfamily EMFILE} errors can possibly occur anywhere in your application, because everything is using the same core {\ttfamily fs} module, which is patched. However, it can also obviously cause undesirable side-\/effects, especially if the module is loaded multiple times.

Implementing a separate-\/but-\/identical patched {\ttfamily fs} module is more surgical (and doesn\textquotesingle{}t run the risk of patching multiple times), but also imposes the challenge of keeping in sync with the core module.

The current approach loads the {\ttfamily fs} module, and then creates a lookalike object that has all the same methods, except a few that are patched. It is safe to use in all versions of Node from 0.\+8 through 7.\+0.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1272}{}\doxysubsection{v4}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_graceful_fs__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1272}
