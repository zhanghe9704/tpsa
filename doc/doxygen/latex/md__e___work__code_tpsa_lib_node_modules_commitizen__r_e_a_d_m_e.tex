When you commit with Commitizen, you\textquotesingle{}ll be prompted to fill out any required commit fields at commit time. No more waiting until later for a git commit hook to run and reject your commit (though \href{https://github.com/kentcdodds/validate-commit-msg}{\texttt{ that}} can still be helpful). No more digging through \mbox{\hyperlink{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g}{CONTRIBUTING.md}} to find what the preferred format is.

Commitizen is currently tested against Node.\+js 12, 14, \& 16, although it may work in older versions of Node.\+js. You should also have npm 6 or greater.

Installation is as simple as running the following command (if you see {\ttfamily EACCES} error, reading \href{https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions}{\texttt{ fixing npm permissions}} may help)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm install -\/g commitizen}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md833}{}\doxysection{Using the command line tool}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md833}

Simply use {\ttfamily git cz} or just {\ttfamily cz} instead of {\ttfamily git commit} when committing. You can also use {\ttfamily git-\/cz}, which is an alias for {\ttfamily cz}.

{\itshape Alternatively}, if you are using {\bfseries{npm 5.\+2+}} you can \href{https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b}{\texttt{ use {\ttfamily npx}}} instead of installing globally\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npx cz}

\end{DoxyCode}


or as an npm script\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{"{}scripts"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "{}commit"{}: "{}cz"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


When you\textquotesingle{}re working in a Commitizen-\/friendly repository, you\textquotesingle{}ll be prompted to fill in any required fields, and your commit messages will be formatted according to the standards defined by project maintainers.

\href{https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/raw/master/meta/screenshots/add-commit.png}{\texttt{ }}\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md835}{}\doxysubsection{If your repo is NOT Commitizen friendly\+:}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md835}
If you\textquotesingle{}re {\bfseries{not}} working in a Commitizen-\/friendly repository, then {\ttfamily git cz} will work just the same as {\ttfamily git commit}, but {\ttfamily npx cz} will use the \href{https://github.com/streamich/git-cz}{\texttt{ streamich/git-\/cz}} adapter. To fix this, you need to first \href{\#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly}{\texttt{ make your repo Commitizen friendly}}\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md836}{}\doxysection{Making your repo Commitizen friendly}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md836}
For this example, we\textquotesingle{}ll be setting up our repo to use \href{https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md\#-git-commit-guidelines}{\texttt{ Angular\+JS\textquotesingle{}s commit message convention}}, also known as \href{https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog}{\texttt{ conventional-\/changelog}}.

First, install the Commitizen CLI tools\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npm install commitizen -\/g}

\end{DoxyCode}


Next, initialize your project to use the cz-\/conventional-\/changelog adapter by typing\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# npm}
\DoxyCodeLine{commitizen init cz-\/conventional-\/changelog -\/-\/save-\/dev -\/-\/save-\/exact}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# yarn}
\DoxyCodeLine{commitizen init cz-\/conventional-\/changelog -\/-\/yarn -\/-\/dev -\/-\/exact}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# pnpm}
\DoxyCodeLine{commitizen init cz-\/conventional-\/changelog -\/-\/pnpm -\/-\/save-\/dev -\/-\/save-\/exact}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that if you want to force install over the top of an old adapter, you can apply the {\ttfamily -\/-\/force} argument. For more information on this, just run {\ttfamily commitizen help}.

The above command does three things for you\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Installs the cz-\/conventional-\/changelog adapter npm module
\item Saves it to {\ttfamily package.\+json}\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily dependencies} or {\ttfamily dev\+Dependencies}
\item Adds the {\ttfamily config.\+commitizen} key to the root of your {\ttfamily package.\+json} file as shown here\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "{}config"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "{}commitizen"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{      "{}path"{}: "{}cz-\/conventional-\/changelog"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Alternatively, Commitizen configs may be added to a {\ttfamily .czrc} file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "{}path"{}: "{}cz-\/conventional-\/changelog"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


This just tells Commitizen which adapter we actually want our contributors to use when they try to commit to this repo.

{\ttfamily commitizen.\+path} is resolved via \href{https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html\#globals_require_resolve}{\texttt{ require.\+resolve}} and supports\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item npm modules
\item directories relative to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()} containing an {\ttfamily index.\+js} file
\item file base names relative to {\ttfamily process.\+cwd()} with {\ttfamily .js} extension
\item full relative file names
\item absolute paths
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please note that in the previous version of Commitizen we used cz\+Config. {\bfseries{cz\+Config has been deprecated}}, and you should migrate to the new format before Commitizen 3.\+0.\+0.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md837}{}\doxysubsection{Optional\+: Install and run Commitizen locally}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md837}
Installing and running Commitizen locally allows you to make sure that developers are running the exact same version of Commitizen on every machine.

Install Commitizen with {\ttfamily npm install -\/-\/save-\/dev commitizen}.

On {\bfseries{npm 5.\+2+}} you can \href{https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b}{\texttt{ use {\ttfamily npx}}} to initialize the conventional changelog adapter\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{npx commitizen init cz-\/conventional-\/changelog -\/-\/save-\/dev -\/-\/save-\/exact}

\end{DoxyCode}


For {\bfseries{previous versions of npm ($<$ 5.\+2)}} you can execute {\ttfamily ./node\+\_\+modules/.bin/commitizen} or {\ttfamily ./node\+\_\+modules/.bin/cz} in order to actually use the commands.

You can then initialize the conventional changelog adapter using\+: {\ttfamily ./node\+\_\+modules/.bin/commitizen init cz-\/conventional-\/changelog -\/-\/save-\/dev -\/-\/save-\/exact}

And you can then add some nice npm scripts in your {\ttfamily package.\+json} file pointing to the local version of Commitizen\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{"{}scripts"{}: \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  "{}commit"{}: "{}cz"{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will be more convenient for your users because then if they want to do a commit, all they need to do is run {\ttfamily npm run commit} and they will get the prompts needed to start a commit!

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries{NOTE\+:}} If you are using {\ttfamily precommit} hooks thanks to something like \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily husky}}}, you will need to name your script something other than {\ttfamily \char`\"{}commit\char`\"{}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily \char`\"{}cm\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}cz\char`\"{}}). The reason is because npm scripts has a \char`\"{}feature\char`\"{} where it automatically runs scripts with the name {\itshape prexxx} where {\itshape xxx} is the name of another script. In essence, npm and husky will run {\ttfamily \char`\"{}precommit\char`\"{}} scripts twice if you name the script {\ttfamily \char`\"{}commit\char`\"{}}, and the workaround is to prevent the npm-\/triggered {\itshape precommit} script. \end{quote}

This example shows how to incorporate Commitizen into the existing {\ttfamily git commit} workflow by using git hooks and the {\ttfamily -\/-\/hook} command-\/line option. This is useful for project maintainers who wish to ensure the proper commit format is enforced on contributions from those unfamiliar with Commitizen.

Once either of these methods is implemented, users running {\ttfamily git commit} will be presented with an interactive Commitizen session that helps them write useful commit messages.

To create an adapter, just fork one of these great adapters and modify it to suit your needs. We pass you an instance of \href{https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/}{\texttt{ Inquirer.\+js}}, but you can capture input using whatever means necessary. Just call the {\ttfamily commit} callback with a string and we\textquotesingle{}ll be happy. Publish it to npm, and you\textquotesingle{}ll be all set!\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md848}{}\doxysection{Retrying failed commits}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md848}
As of version 2.\+7.\+1, you may attempt to retry the last commit using the {\ttfamily git cz -\/-\/retry} command. This can be helpful when you have tests set up to run via a git precommit hook. In this scenario, you may have attempted a Commitizen commit, painstakingly filled out all of the commitizen fields, but your tests fail. In previous Commitizen versions, after fixing your tests, you would be forced to fill out all of the fields again. Enter the retry command. Commitizen will retry the last commit that you attempted in this repo without you needing to fill out the fields again.

Please note that the retry cache may be cleared when upgrading Commitizen versions, upgrading adapters, or if you delete the {\ttfamily commitizen.\+json} file in your home or temp directory. Additionally, the commit cache uses the filesystem path of the repo, so if you move a repo or change its path, you will not be able to retry a commit. This is an edge case but might be confusing if you have scenarios where you are moving folders that contain repos.

It is important to note that if you are running {\ttfamily cz} from an npm script (let\textquotesingle{}s say it is called {\ttfamily commit}) you will need to do one of the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pass {\ttfamily -\/-\/ -\/-\/retry} as an argument for your script. i.\+e\+: {\ttfamily npm run commit -\/-\/ -\/-\/retry}
\item Use \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx}{\texttt{ npx}} to find and call the {\ttfamily cz} executable directly. i.\+e\+: {\ttfamily npx cz -\/-\/retry}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that the last two options {\bfseries{do not}} require you to pass {\ttfamily -\/-\/} before the args but the first {\bfseries{does}}.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md849}{}\doxysection{Commitizen for project maintainers}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md849}
As a project maintainer, making your repo Commitizen friendly allows you to select pre-\/existing commit message conventions or to create your own custom commit message convention. When a contributor to your repo uses Commitizen, they will be prompted for the correct fields at commit time.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md850}{}\doxysection{Go further}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md850}
Commitizen is great on its own, but it shines when you use it with some other amazing open source tools. Kent C. Dodds shows you how to accomplish this in his Egghead.\+io series, \href{https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library}{\texttt{ How to Write an Open Source Java\+Script Library}}.

Commitizen is an open source project that helps contributors be good open source citizens. It accomplishes this by prompting them to follow commit message conventions at commit time. It also empowers project maintainers to create or use predefined commit message conventions in their repos to better communicate their expectations to potential contributors.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md853}{}\doxysubsection{Commitizen or Commit Hooks}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md853}
Both! Commitizen is not meant to be a replacement for git commit hooks. Rather, it is meant to work side-\/by-\/side with them to ensure a consistent and positive experience for your contributors. Commitizen treats the commit command as a declarative action. The contributor is declaring that they wish to contribute to your project. It is up to you as the maintainer to define what rules they should be following.

We accomplish this by letting you define which adapter you\textquotesingle{}d like to use in your project. Adapters just allow multiple projects to share the same commit message conventions. A good example of an adapter is the cz-\/conventional-\/changelog adapter.\hypertarget{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md854}{}\doxysection{Related projects}\label{md__e___work__code_tpsa_lib_node_modules_commitizen__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md854}
