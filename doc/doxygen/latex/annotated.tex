Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_a_d_order_table}{ADOrder\+Table}} \\*A table that show the relation between the orders and the index of an element in a TPS vector. The orders of an TPS element is a vector of integers that shows the order of each variable in that element. For example, the element x$^\wedge$3$\ast$y$\ast$z$^\wedge$2 in a 3D TPS vector is \char`\"{}3,1,2\char`\"{} }{\pageref{class_a_d_order_table}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_base}{Base}} \\*Bases for DA calculations. The i-\/th base can be accessed as base\mbox{[}i\mbox{]}, where base is an object of \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_base}{Base}} }{\pageref{struct_base}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_d_a_vector}{DAVector}} \\*Differential Algebra (DA) Vector A TPS vector with methods. Can be used with most numerical operators }{\pageref{struct_d_a_vector}}{}
