\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_base}{Base}} \\*Bases for DA calculations. The i-\/th base can be accessed as base\mbox{[}i\mbox{]}, where base is an object of \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_base}{Base}} }{\pageref{struct_base}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_d_a_vector}{D\+A\+Vector}} \\*Differential Algebra (DA) Vector A T\+PS vector with methods. Can be used with most numerical operators }{\pageref{struct_d_a_vector}}{}
