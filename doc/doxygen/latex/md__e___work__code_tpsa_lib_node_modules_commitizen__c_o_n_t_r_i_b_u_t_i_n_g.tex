When using Atom, if you edit some of our tests, atom will remove the whitespace on some lines. Unfortunately we wanted this whitespace to able to test multiline commits and their difference across operating systems. Atom has decided to keep the stripping of whitespace as a default. Although we understand this decision, it has the unfortunate side effect of editing parts of the file that you might not have intended. We think this should be left up to more configurable tools like eslint.

For now, in order to work around this, you can take the steps outlined \href{https://github.com/atom/whitespace/issues/10\#issuecomment-85183781}{\texttt{ here}} to temporarily disable automatic whitespace removal in Atom.
